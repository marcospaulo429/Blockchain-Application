# Computer Vision and Blockchain to detect criminals according to LGPD

In 2024, we did a paper review entitled "Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain in the Metaverse" to understand the applications in this field. This repository serves to develop a practical application with the knowledge acquired.

This project consists of recognizing criminals in surveillance camera videos. To do this, we will have a database with people who are considered criminals, so our application will have to recognize one or more of these faces during the video. We will use Blockchain to ensure compliance with the LGBD, guarantee privacy and also use knowledge acquired from our paper.
